# Thirty

## Description of the game Thirty:
Thirty is a dice game similar to Yatzy, where players take turns rolling six dice. After each roll, the player can choose to reroll any number of dice up to two times. In each turn, the player selects which dice to reroll and which dice to keep. After the three rolls, the player calculates the score based on the dice values. A game consists of 10 rounds like this, totaling a maximum of 30 rolls, hence the name of the game.

## Scoring:
During scoring, the player chooses what to count for that round. See the table below for the possible choices. Each choice can only be made once during a game. When calculating the score, the value of each die can be counted only once. At the end of the game, the player's total score is displayed, along with the points obtained for each possible choice.
